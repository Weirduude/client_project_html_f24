            <p>
                We believe in ensuring fair and equitable access to food and essential resources. When everyone has what they need, our community thrives, and our students achieve greater success.
                <br>
                This website is designed to provide information about the resources available to students. It also serves as a platform for sharing data and research, helping the U-M community recognize the significance of this work for the entire campus.
                <br>
                Led by Student Life and supported by academic units and campus partners, this initiative continues to grow as new resources are identified and developed. We appreciate your patience as we expand this valuable resource.
